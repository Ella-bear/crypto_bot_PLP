Features

- Uses a predefined dataset for three cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano.

- Rule-based logic with simple if-else statements to answer queries about:

    - Trending coins (rising price trends)
    - Best long-term investment options
    - Listing available coins
    - Handling definition requests and basic query guidance

- “What’s the most sustainable coin?”
- “What’s a good long-term investment?”
- “List all coins available.”

Type “exit” or “quit” to end the chat.

How It Works

1. The bot matches user queries with keywords to determine intent.
2. It analyzes the predefined crypto data and returns responses based on logic for sustainability, trends, and investment potential.
3. If the query doesn’t match any logic, it guides the user to ask relevant questions.
